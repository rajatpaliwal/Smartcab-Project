# Smartcab-Project
Constructed an optimized Q-Learning driving agent that will navigate a Smartcab through its environment towards a goal. Smartcab is expected to drive passengers from one location to another, the driving agent will be evaluated on two very important metrics: Safety and Reliability. A driving agent that gets the Smartcab to its destination while running red lights or narrowly avoiding accidents would be considered unsafe. Similarly, a driving agent that frequently fails to reach the destination in time would be considered unreliable. 
Achieved a safety rating of A+(Agent commits no traffic violations,and always chooses the correct action) and a reliability rating of A(Agent reaches the destination on time for at least 90% of trips).
